/*
Identifiers in C++
Identifiers are names used to label variables, functions, classes, etc.
In above example balance and age are Identifiers.

They must start with a letter or underscore, and can contain letters, digits, and underscores.

They are case-sensitive (Score â‰  score).

Reserved keywords like int, class, return cannot be used as identifiers.

Naming conventions:

Variables/functions: camelCase (e.g., userAge)

Classes: PascalCase (e.g., StudentRecord)

Constants: ALL_CAPS (e.g., MAX_SIZE)
